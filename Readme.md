# Engine Algorithms
This project is the result of the subject Engine Algorithms at Saxion University.
The goal was to implement and improve the SAT algorithm as much as possible.
## My final result features:
* Report on the Engine [[Markdown]](EngineReport.md)[[PDF]](EngineReport.pdf)[[DOCX]](EngineReport.docx)
* OctTree implementation
* Dynamic Node Removal
* Sphere Testing
* Dynamic & Static Colliders
* Various Rendering Engine improvements
* KD Tree implementation(replaced by OctTree
* Automated Testing/Benchmarking
